This experiment is set up exclusively using Jupyter Notebook, ensuring that all functions and classes are self-contained. We recommend using Python 3.6 or later versions, although any Python 3 version should be compatible.

The libraries utilized in this experiment are as follows:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
tensorflow
keras
tqdm

The experiments on two distinct datasets and problems are separated into two notebooks for convenience: "experiment1-seed.ipynb" and "experiment2-seed.ipynb". The datasets are provided in CSV format: "BTCUSD_3yrs_Daily.csv" and "ETHUSD_1yrs_15MinInterval.csv".
